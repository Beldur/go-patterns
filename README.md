# Go Examples of Common Patterns

This is a collection of common design patterns translated into Go.
The goal of this repository is to help programmers coming from other
language communities to Go for the first time.

We do not intended to be restrict this to the traditional
[GoF Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns). We hope
to include any language idiom you'd like to see re-implemented in a more
idiomatic Go design. Suggestions are welcomed. If there is a pattern you'd
like to see or contribute, please file an
[issue](https://github.com/jbuberel/go-patterns/issues).
